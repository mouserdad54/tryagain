<h2>Hello, Im Shane Wade and this is my Bio!!!</h2>
<p>I was born in 1977 in hillsboro Oregon at Tuality Hospital.<br>
    I Grew up in the Pacific N.W. i went to high school in forest grove oregon<br>
        and during my freshman year my mother passed after a prolonged bout of cancer<br>
    I stumbled and had a hard time finding myself and my way. I met a lady from las vegas.<br>
    She was attending college in my hometown and she let me know there was more than <br>
     grey skies and rain so with much trepitation, I left my homestate and first we traveled to <br>
     california and there i was married and we had a son named damien. form there it was off to <br>
     nevada where i was blessed with another son trevor, my marriage lasted 19yrs when we both<br>
     decieded that there was more to life out there, we divorced amicable and im happy to say my<br>
     family is happy and healthy as am i. I have lived in Las vegas Nv since 2001 and i love the heat,<br>
      but i still dream of the ocean and have a full intention of returning to it. I have done many<br>
       things in life and my profesional career as a team leader and trainer, but my faith in god is what<br>
        im most proud of followed by my family. I have a new dream and i feel a call from across the ocean so<br>
    im gonna make it happen with faith and a new love who ive been making life plans with and she <br>
    happens to live next to the ocean     </p></div>
